# Mood-based-Music-Playlist-Generator
  A simple, console-based Java application that generates a music playlist based on the user's specified mood. This project is designed as a great starting point for beginners learning Java, focusing on     core concepts like classes, objects, lists, and user input handling.

  Dynamic Playlist Generation: Selects and displays a curated list of songs that match the chosen mood.
  Extensible Music Library: The internal music library can be easily expanded with more songs and moods.
  Graceful Exit: Allows the user to quit the application smoothly.

Tech Stack
  Language: Java
  Phase I: Console-based implementation
  Phase II (upcoming): With Database (JDBC + MySQL/SQLite)

Future Enhancements
  This project has a lot of potential for expansion. Here are a few ideas:

  [ ] Load Songs from a File: Read the music library from an external file (e.g., CSV or JSON) instead of hardcoding it.

  [ ] Expand the Library: Add more songs and introduce new mood categories.

  [ ] API Integration: Connect to a music service API (like Spotify or YouTube) to fetch song data and playback links.

  [ ] Add/Remove Songs: Implement functionality for users to add their own songs to the library during runtime.
